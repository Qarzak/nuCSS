# Roadmap

Here is the roadmap I planned for this project. It consists of steps I care about to offer with nuCSS a complete, clean and efficient framework. These steps are :

* Components

* Sass functions and mixins

* Conventions and naming

* Reusability

* Semantics

* Cross browser and devices compatibility

* Cleaning

* Launch

I will elaborate and explain more clearly these steps later on this file. In the meantime, you can test the framework and express any ideas or concerns you have.
